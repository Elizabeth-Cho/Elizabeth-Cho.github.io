            <p>Project Firestorm is a choose-your-own-adventure game based in a
              fictional society in which the player's actions influence the
              status of the society. A teaser version of the game was
              developed as a part of my senior capstone project, but the full
              version of the game will be developed as a personal project.</p>

            <p>This purpose of this project was to create a model of a solution
              for the issue of emergency room overcrowding. The model created
              from this was a program that would help to automate the triage
              process. The patient would answer questions about the reason for
              their visit and the severity of their symptoms. Based off of the
              responses, the program would sort and process their information
              and recommend which specialists to see.</p>

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOKzoHJDjA"><i>FIRST</i> Stronghold</a>.
              The game allows the player to control a robot and gain points by breaching
              defenses and shoot boulders into a tower. The probability of the player
              making the shot is dependent on how far away they are from the tower.
              At the end of the game, points from breached defenses and boulders shot
              at the tower, mimicking the scoring mechanics of the real-life game.</p>

            <p>The task for this project was to create a program that could
              encrypt and decrypt messages with a method of encryption of our
              choice. This program encrypts messages with a substitution cipher.
              The user inputs an alphabet, a word, and the message they want to
              encrypt. If given the alphabet, word, and an encrypted message,
              the program is able to decrypt said message.</p>
