      <h3>September Advisor Meetings</h3>
      <p>I have met with my advisor a couple of times and topics discussed included
        the general idea and path for my research and final product and potential
        next steps, such as ideas for community connections. Following the
        networking conference, the idea of recruiting a "support team" was also
        mentioned, where I would delegate some of the parts of the final product
        to others who were willing to help me, rather than attempting to manage
        every single aspect of my planned final project and balance my schoolwork
        and extracurriculars.</p>

      <h3>Capstone Networking Conference: September 26, 2017</h3>
      <p>At this conference, I met with a professional who did work in a field
        similar to my research topic, who happened to work on more of the
        business side of the idea I had. One main takkeaway I got from this event
        was the idea of recruiting other students for a team so I could focus
        more on the coding part of the project and I could delegate art and
        marketing to other people. I added this tip to my design plan and allocated
        time to look for who might be a good fit for the role of marketing. </p>

      <h3>Advisor Meeting: October 13, 2017</h3>
      <p>I had this meeting mainly to discuss my design plan, which included
        going over it and seeing what could be added and improved. After this
        meeting, I added approximate deadlines for each step in the task list and
        explitly listed out who my specific resources for each step.</p>

      <h3>Advisor Meeting: October 20, 2017</h3>
      <p>This was a shorter meeting and what was mainly discussed was how I would
        approach my goal of improving my public speaking skills. I initially
        planned on practicing with robotics meetings because I often have to stand
        up in front of the team to talk about current projects and upcoming events.
        However, it was suggested that I find someone who I could specifically
        talk to so I could work on my public speaking skills because I wanted to
        work on both speaking in front of a larger audience and one-on-one with
        professionals.</p>

      <h3>Capstone Design Plan</h3>
      <p>I spent a considerable amount of effort in writing out the steps and
        thinking of who to ask as references. Rather than saving all of the work
        for last, I worked on it during class and at home and took time to meet
        with my advisor for advice on where it could be improved. I also got more
        ideas for who I could talk to for help because I don't know too many
        people who specialize in web development. While working on the design
        plan, I thought of the specific steps I would typically need to go through
        when working on a software project, such as back-end design, front-end
        design, and debugging. I also went through what I typically had to go
        through in a day when coming up with information about potential obstacles.</p>
