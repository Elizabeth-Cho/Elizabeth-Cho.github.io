        HopHacks is a 36-hour biannual hackathon held at Johns Hopkins University that encourages engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs to explore new ideas and create new applications. Teams of up to 4 university students work on software or hardware projects from scratch. At the end of the hackathon, teams present their projects to judges and compete for prizes.
