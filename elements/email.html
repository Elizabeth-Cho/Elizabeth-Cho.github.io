                <h1>Here's the first thing</h1>
                <p>Man, I wish I had something interesting to say, but this
                    is just a layout demo, so the content of this paragraph isn't
                    too important. All that matters is that this style can be
                    used for some other things. As the name of the file implies,
                    this is just a bunch of email templates.</p>
                <p>Now here's a <a>link test</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topic">
                <h1>Here's another thing</h1>
                <p>Oh look at that! Another secton, which should imply a different
                    topic but let's be honest, I'm just typing up whatever I think of
                    so there's not really any topic or organization in terms of what's
                    actually written. (Spoiler alert: There's another section after
                    this.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topic">
                <h1>Here's the last thing</h1>
                <img class="bannerex" src="tempbanner.png">
                <p>Check out this amazing temporary banner from my local files.</p>
                <p>Wow finally made it to the third section. For demo purposes, this
                    doesn't really need any more than three sections. Obviously, there
                    may be some things that have more than three topics, but if this demo
                    is made properly, it should super simple to add another section and
                    the format should follow.</p>
